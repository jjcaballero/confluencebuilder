I followed intructions of section "In a Nutshell" from:
 https:://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest

- From the C++ file create xml file with doxygen (keeping here
  in dataset folder only the needed files)
- Add extension breathe to conf.py
- Define project and path where to find the project (xml file)
- Build with confluence.
